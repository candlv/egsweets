This app make dessert avilabe for customer to order. it is not a real application yet, but it is udacity advanced web development nanodegree project about hosting full stack application.

### My Approach 
- minimized my own previous project storefront application to go through deployment process for better understanding and manipulating cloud and app as I need.
- implement sign up form to register a user 
- impement landing page to fetch all users to inform the application parts are connected and work properly.
- after you register you can go to home page to see your username is posted.
### Chalenges
configure services was easy but most challanges was:
- deploy the backend with cli the problem was alwas with creating source bundle and what file should included.
- yaml syntax, executor, workflows, and jobs taked some time to be familir with.
### enjoyable parts 
- seeing the application run on the internet and can any one access it
- my favorite part is automate taskes, because it make life easer, save time, save effort, and remove repeatative, boring activities. 


Thanks,
Feel good be optimistic.
